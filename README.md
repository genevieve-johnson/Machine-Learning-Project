Harry Potter Sorting Tool for machine learning course

The Harry Potter dataset from Jakob et al. 2019 (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/RTF74) consisted of 988 responses from a personality questionnaire. A small group and I constructed a pipeline implementing several different machine learning algorithms, as well as multiple styles of parameter optimization.

Along with demographic information, the personality dataset included the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP 50) to measure an individual's score of the Big Five traits: extraversion, conscientiousness, agreeableness, emotional stability, and openness to experience (Goldberg et al., 2006). The dataset also looked at the Short Dark Triad (SD3) to measure an individual's score for psychopathy, machiavellianism, and narcissism (Jones & Paulhus, 2013). Finally the Portrait Value Questionnaire (PVQ) was used to measure human values of an individual and their life goals (Schwartz et al 2012). 




To compare our results, we used scikit-learnâ€™s DummyClassifier method to build a baseline model using the stratified strategy parameter and it gave an accuracy score of 27%.
